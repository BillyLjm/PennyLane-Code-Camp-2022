    "# Gradients: Adjoint differentiation (500 points)\n",
    "In the last two problems, we dove into the parameter-shift rule. It's an elegant, simple, and *extremely* useful way to differentiate quantum circuits because of its hardware compatibility. There are other differentiation methods that exist and are very efficient, but are *not* hardware compatible in general. We'll describe a way to perform one of those methods in this challenge: adjoint differentiation.\n",

    "Consider a circuit given by a unitary $U(\\vec{\\theta}) = \\prod_{i=1}^n U_i(\\theta_i)$, where $\\vec{\\theta}$ are real differentiable parameters, whose output is an expectation value with respect to an observable $A$:\n",

There are two instances in $f(\\vec{\\theta})$ that involve dependence on $\\theta_i$: one from $U_i(\\theta_i)$ and one from $U_i^{\\dagger}(\\theta_i)$. Thus, we will have to use the product rule as follows.\n",
